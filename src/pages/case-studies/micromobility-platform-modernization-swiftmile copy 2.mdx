blocks:
  challenge: >-
    As a part of its business turnaround strategy, Swiftmile was preparing for its next phase of global expansion. To cope with any business and technical demands for growth, the company wanted to improve and scale the platform’s infrastructure, and add advanced capabilities for data streaming. The final goal was to receive a robust, highly scalable, data-powered micromobility management platform that would enable Swiftmile to accelerate business growth, reduce operational costs, and improve user experience through faster data processing and higher-quality service, with zero-incidence performance.
  solution: >-
    Provectus reviewed the infrastructure of the Swiftmile platform. It had been designed and built as a monolithic application, which limited Swiftmile’s potential to innovate due to slower releases, reduced scalability, and higher development and operational costs. The solution was to build a new microservice-based data platform on AWS. The platform was developed using a combination of AWS services, Apache Kafka, Java stack, and Swiss Army Kube (SAK). The Provectus team ensured stable performance during deployment, migration, and implementation of the platform and of its new features.
  outcome: >-
    In just seven months, Swiftmile received a sophisticated data platform designed to collect, process, and utilize various types of data. The new, highly scalable infrastructure of the platform increased its performance and capacity by 20x, with the same cloud infrastructure costs. It enabled Swiftmile to quickly scale business use cases and models, and add new functionality, data sources and pipelines, without the need to change the overall structure of the platform. The platform demonstrated 100% system availability. Two months into the new platform’s adoption, no incidents had been detected.

## More Advanced Cloud Infrastructure, Faster Data Processing Capabilities for Real Micromobility

Swiftmile, a universal charging platform for micromobility, was preparing for the next phase of its worldwide expansion. The company was evaluating new market opportunities and testing different business models in the dynamic market environment. The leadership was also exploring partnership opportunities with such global brands as Spin, Lime, and Bird.

However, Swiftmile’s potential for growth was limited by its own micromobility platform. The team realized that the platform’s backend logic and monolith infrastructure had to be overhauled, and the platform itself had to be substantially modernized. They needed to design and build a robust, highly scalable, cloud-based platform that would enable them to:

Maximize scaling potential, to cope with any demands for business growth, including adding new stations and third-party integrations
Simplify the integration of new incoming and outgoing communication streams, such as OEM systems protocols, Salesforce, etc.
Prepare for worldwide expansion, both technology- and business-wise, while keeping down the costs of handling the platform’s infrastructure
Aside from improvements to the backend logic and infrastructure, the team at Swiftmile sought to make their platform data-driven. Specifically, they wanted to gain the ability to collect, process, and analyze streaming data in real time, to provide higher-quality service and improve user experience. In addition, the improvements would help the company to explore data business opportunities by making it easier to add open data sources and integrate routing features of Google Maps, to ensure genuine micromobility.

To support the existing scaling commitments defined in contracts and technical needs of new business verticals, Swiftmile reached out to Provectus, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner with Data & Analytics Competency. The teams started with a discovery workshop to assess Swiftmile’s current state of business and technology, and to define a comprehensive strategy to move forward.
