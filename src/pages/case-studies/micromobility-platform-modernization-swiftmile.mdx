  challenge: The client was ready to begin a large-scale digital transformation, to gain capabilities to unlock the digital value from the vast amounts of information generated during a clinical visit. A machine learning-powered platform that could collect, process, integrate, and analyze various clinical data to drive the client’s BI and analytics was envisioned as a potential solution. The client needed assistance designing and building the platform.
  solution: In collaboration with the client, Provectus worked out a four-step strategy to develop a desired data solution. Given the sensitivity of clinical data, the platform was designed and built as a combination of Provectus’ IDP solution, Amazon Comprehend Medical, and other AWS services in a HIPAA compliant environment on AWS. Best practices for data engineering, MLOps, and machine learning were applied to deliver the final solution.
  outcome: >-
    Our client received a comprehensive document and data processing platform for BI and analytics, built on a foundation of Provectus’ IDP solution and AWS services. The platform enabled the client to capture, structure, and integrate clinical data in various forms and formats.

## Acquiring and Integrating Clinical Data in Various Formats to Enable BI & Analytics

Our client, under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), is the nation’s leading provider of acute care management. The company manages emergency, observation, and critical care departments across the country, which positions it uniquely as a facilitator at every stage of the professional medical services lifecycle.
Specifically, the client wanted to gain the ability to acquire, integrate, and leverage various types of claim and clinical data in a digital and structured format for Business Intelligence (BI) and analytics. By making all data from the professional medical services lifecycle easily accessible across the organization, they would be able to garner business-critical insights, for improved decision making. Better access to integrated, structured data would also enable the client to explore intelligent automation and machine learning use cases.

Given the complexities associated with handling claim and clinical data, building a solution for capturing, structuring, and integrating information from various types of non-digital and digital documents can pose considerable challenges. It would require developing a robust document and data processing platform with a HIPAA-compliant medical data lake, and advanced document processing capabilities.

After exploring the solutions available on the market, the client opted to join forces with Provectus, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner with AWS Data & Analytics, and Machine Learning competencies, to develop such a platform based on the Provectus Intelligent Document Processing solution.
